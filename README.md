        - Average Purchase Price
        - Total number of Purchases
        - Total Revenue

### 3. Gender Demographics ###
        - Percentage and Count of Male Players
        - Percentage and Count of Female Players
        - Percentage and Count of Other/Non- Dislosed

        - Percentage and Count of Female Players
        - Percentage and Count of Other/Non- Dislosed
        - Total Revenue

        - Average Purchase Price
        - Total Purchase Value 
  
### 7. Most Popular Items ###

As final considerations: 

- You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
- You must submit a link to your Github/Git Lab repo that contains your Jupyter Notebook.
- You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
